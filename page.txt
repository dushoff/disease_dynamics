TSS Stochastic models

	For a given set of assumptions, a stochastic model predicts a variety of 
	possible results

	In other words, there is room for randomness (stochasticity) inside our
	model world

		We may think the world is really stochastic

		Or simply that there are things we can't predict â€¦
