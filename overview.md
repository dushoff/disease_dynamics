EXTRA 2025 April for Georgia Southern

Dynamical models of infectious-disease spread

I will talk about some principles of modeling the spread of infectious diseases, with examples from Ebola, HIV, rabies, COVID-19 and influenza. Dynamical modeling is an essential tool for understanding infectious disease spread, assessing disease burden, and planning interventions, but simple dynamical models also have many limitations.

EXTRA Abstract 2023 March NEF Webinar

Dynamical models of disease spread

Abstract: I will talk about some principles of modeling the spread of infectious diseases, with examples from Ebola, HIV, rabies, COVID-19 and influenza. Dynamical modeling raises mathematically interesting questions, and is an essential tool for studying diseases the spread through populations. There is more interesting work to be done, both practically and theoretically.

Outline from original development (Taiwan 2023)

Tools
* Conceptual/Analytical
* Deterministic simulation
* Stochastic simulation
* Statistical fitting

Questions
* What is likely to happen
* What could change that?
* How can people try to make it change?

Problems
* Heterogeneity
* Behaviour change

Examples
* alpha and omicron waves
* HIV (heterogeneity and test-treat)
* Ebola (include speed strength simple-example)
* Within-host modeling
