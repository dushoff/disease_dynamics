	This talk is given at DAIDD, and at MMED to the DAIDD-track types. 

		There are currently no conceptual differences (only the words
		DAIDD and MMED need to be changed, and years updates)

	Nobody should hear it twice (DAIDD graduates should not be in this track)

Goals

	This lecture will:

		introduce the idea of dynamical modeling

		explain why dynamical modeling is a key tool for understanding infectious
		disease

		discuss and demonstrate simple dynamical models from the SIR model family

		investigate some insights that can be gained from these models

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Dynamical modeling connects scales

REP DBFIG 0.7 my_images/trans.jpg 1 Disease_data/ewmeas.Rout.pdf

	Start with rules about how things change in short time steps

		Usually based on \emph{individuals}

	Calculate results over longer time periods

		Usually about \emph{populations}

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Compartmental models

SUBH Divide people into categories:

DIAGRAM SIR_model_family/sir.three.pdf

	Susceptible $\to$ Infectious $\to$ Recovered

----------------------------------------------------------------------

What determines transition rates?

REP DIAGRAM SIR_model_family/sir.three.pdf

	People get better independently

	People get infected by infectious people

Conceptual modeling

REP DIAGRAM SIR_model_family/sir.three.pdf

	What is the final result?

	When does disease increase, decrease?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Dynamic implementation

REP DIAGRAM SIR_model_family/sir.three.pdf

	Requires assumptions about recovery and transmission

	The \emph{conceptually simplest} implementation uses
	Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)

		Other options may be more realistic

		Or simpler in practice

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Recovery

REP DIAGRAM SIR_model_family/sir.three.pdf

	Infectious people recover at \emph{per capita}
	rate $\gamma$

		Total recovery rate is $\gamma I$

		Mean time infectious is $D = 1/\gamma$

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Transmission

REP DIAGRAM SIR_model_family/sir.three.pdf

	Susceptible people get infected by:

		Going around and contacting people (rate $c$)

		Some of these people are infectious (proportion $I/N$)

		Some of these contacts are effective (proportion $p$)

	Per capita rate of becoming infected is $c p I/N \equiv \beta
	I/N$

	Population-level transmission rate is ${\cal T} = \beta SI/N$

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Another perspective on transmission

REP DIAGRAM SIR_model_family/sir.three.pdf

	Infectious people infect others by:

		Going around and contacting people (rate $c$)

		Some of these people are susceptible (proportion $S/N$)

		Some of these contacts are effective (proportion $p$)

	Per capita rate of infecting others is $c p S/N \equiv \beta
	S/N$

	Population-level transmission rate is ${\cal T} = \beta SI/N$

ODE assumptions

	Lots and lots of people

	Perfectly mixed

ODE assumptions

DBFIG 0.8 SIR_model_family/exp.Rout-0.pdf 0.8 SIR_model_family/exp.Rout-1.pdf

	Waiting times are exponentially distributed

	Rarely realistic

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Scripts vs.\ spreadsheets

PIC DBFIG 0.7 SIR_model_family/gd.png 0.8 SIR_model_family/R.png

	Scripts are more transparent, less redundant

	Spreadsheets are more intuitive for simple problems

----------------------------------------------------------------------

More about transmission

BC

SIDEFIG my_images/trans.jpg

NC

	$\beta = pc$

		What is a contact?

		What is the probability of transmission?

	Sometimes this decomposition is clear

	But usually it's not

EC

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Population sizes

	How does $\beta$ change with population size?

	Recall that $\beta$ is the \emph{per capita} rate of contacts

FIG SIR_model_family/beta.Rout-0.pdf

	$\beta(N) = \beta_0$

	${\cal T} = \frac{\beta_0 SI}{N}$

	Also known as \emph{frequency-dependent} transmission

----------------------------------------------------------------------

FIG SIR_model_family/beta.Rout-1.pdf

	$\beta(N) = \beta_1 N$

	${\cal T} = \beta_1 SI$

	Also known as \emph{density-dependent} transmission

----------------------------------------------------------------------

FIG SIR_model_family/beta.Rout-3.pdf

	Per-capita rate:

		May not go to zero when $N$ does

		May not go to $\infty$ when $N$ does

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Digression -- units

	${\cal T} = \beta SI/N: [\mathrm{ppl}/\mathrm{time}]$

	$\beta: [1/\mathrm{time}]$

		$\beta/\gamma = \beta D: [1]$

		Standard incidence, $\beta_0: [1/\mathrm{time}]$

		Mass-action incidence, $\beta_1: [1/(\mathrm{people} \cdot \mathrm{time})]$

Tendency to oscillate

LANDFIG SIR_model_family/comp0.pdf

	Many susceptibles 
	$\rightarrow$ many infections 
	$\rightarrow$ few susceptibles 
	$\rightarrow$ few infections 
	$\rightarrow$ \ldots

	Oscillations in simple models tend to be ``damped"

----------------------------------------------------------------------

With individuality

LANDFIG SIR_model_family/comp.pdf

	Treating individuals as individuals can produce substantial oscillations
	even in large populations

	Interaction between random effects and the different time scales (of infection and recovery)

Summary

	Dynamic models are an essential tool because they allow us to link between
	scales

	There are many ways to construct and implement dynamic models

	Very simple models can provide useful insights

		Reproductive numbers and thresholds

		Tendency for oscillation (and tendency for damping)

	More complex models can provide more detail, but also require more
	assumptions, and more choices

	Understanding simple models can help guide our understanding of more
	complicated models
