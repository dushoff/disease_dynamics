EXTRA MMED 2017 Notes (deleted those dealt with fully!)

● Explain dotted horizontal line as soon as it appears and what intersection means
● Show model matching eq and not growth on slide 21 as well as vice versa

● Needs more time, probably 10 min
● With more time spend some on rescaling from R to c

SEC Homogeneous disease models

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Expanding our models

	\textbf{Homogeneous} models assume everyone has the same:

		disease characteristics (e.g. susceptibility, tendency to
		transmit)

		mixing rate

		probability of mixing with each person

	\textbf{Heterogeneous} models allow people to be different

----------------------------------------------------------------

The basic reproductive number

	$\Ro$ is the number of people who would be infected by an
	infectious individual \emph{in a fully susceptible population.}

	$\Ro = \beta/\gamma = \beta D = (cp) D$

		$c$: Contact Rate

		$p$: Probability of transmission (infectivity)

		$D$: Average duration of infection

	A disease can invade a population if and only if $\Ro>1$.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Equilibrium

LANDFIG SIR_model_family/comp.pdf

	Equilibrium is worth knowing even if the disease doesn't reach equilibrium

	System will move around the equilibrium

----------------------------------------------------------------------

EXTRA PSLIDE Model taxonomy

FIG taxon.jpg

Cut for time. Also, complicated. equilibrium analysis doesn't quite fit the taxonomy

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Equilibrium analysis 

	$\Reffec$ is the number of people who would be infected by an
	infectious individual \emph{in a general population.}

	$\ds\Reffec =  \Ro  \frac SN = pcD \frac SN$

	At equilibrium:
		$\ds \Reffec = \Ro  \frac SN = 1. $

	Thus:
		$\ds \frac SN = 1/R_0.  $

	Proportion `affected' is $V = 1-S/N = 1-1/R_0$.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proportion affected

	Proportion `affected' is $V = 1-S/N = 1-1/R_0$.

		ANS The same formula as the critical vaccination proportion!

		ANS If this proportion is made unavailable, the disease cannot spread

		ANS At least, in the homogeneous case

EXTRA Proportion affected and disease prevalence

Cut for time. Expand lecture?

	For diseases with no recovery, $V$ is the disease prevalence

	For other diseases, $V$ still underlies prevalence:
	
		the equilibrium value of $P=I/N$ is
	$V$ times the ratio of time spent sick to the time spent immune.

	Example: measles before vaccination

		$V = 0.95$ 

		$\bar P = 0.95\times(2\mathrm{wk}/60\mathrm{yr})$.

Large-scale heterogeneity

PIC HFIG 0.64 tmpfigs/schisto.png

	For schistosomiasis, the worldwide average $\Ro<1$

	Disease persists because of specific populations with $\Ro>1$.

	This effect operates at many scales.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

SEC Effects of heterogeneity

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Heterogeneity among hosts

	Differences among people are pervasive, large and often correlated

	We often consider transmission probability as the product of two
	components:

		The "infector" has tendency to infect $\tau$

		The "recipient" has susceptibility $\sigma$

	Then $\Ro = p c D = (\sigma \tau) c D$,

	Why do we assume this is multiplicative?

		ANS Convenience, question this assumption

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Equilibrium calculations

	Assume $p = \sigma\tau$ has a susceptibility component and a
	transmission component:

		$\Ro = \sigma\tau c D$

		$\Reffec = \sigma\tau c D S/N$

		Equilibrium $S/N = 1 - 1/\Ro$

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Equilibrium calculations with heterogeneity

	$\tau D$ applies to infectious individuals $\rightarrow \tau_I
	D_I$

	$\sigma$ applies to susceptible individuals $\rightarrow
	\sigma_S$

	$c$ is complicated $\rightarrow c_S c_I/\bar c$

----------------------------------------------------------------------

RHEAD Equilibrium calculations with heterogeneity

	$\Ro = \sigma_S\tau_I c_x D_I$
	measured during \emph{invasion}

	$\Reffec = \sigma_S\tau_I c_x D_I S/N$
	measured at \emph{equilibrium}

	Equilibrium $S/N \neq 1 - 1/\Ro$

----------------------------------------------------------------------

How does $\Rx$ change?

	Imagine a disease spread by people who differ only in their
	effective mixing rates

	If the disease has just started spreading in the population, how do
	$c_S$ and $c_I$ compare to $\bar c$?

		$c_S \approx \bar c$; $c_I > \bar c$.

	If the disease is very widespread in the population?

		$c_S < \bar c$; $c_I \to \bar c$.

Simpson's paradox

	What happens when a peanut farmer is elected to the US Senate?

	The average IQ goes up in both places!

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The basic reproductive number

	When the disease invades:
	
		The susceptible population $\approx$ the general population

		The infectious population is likely to have higher values of $c$,
		$D$ and/or $\tau$

	$\Ro$ is typically greater than you would expect from a homogeneous
	model


----------------------------------------------------------------------

Equilibrium analysis

	As disease prevalence goes up:

		Susceptible pool is the most resistant, or least exposed group

		Infectious pool moves looks more like the general population.

	$\rightarrow$ lower proportion affected \emph{for a given value of
	\Ro.}

Heterogeneity and disease

BC

	Heterogeneity has a double-edged effect

		Effects of disease are \emph{lower} for a given value of \Ro.

		But \Ro\ is \emph{higher} for given mean values of factors
		underlying transmission

Heterogeneous endemic curves

BC

	Heterogeneity makes the endemic curve flatter

	Disease levels are more resistant to change

NC

SIDEFIG Endemic_curves/propCurves.Rout-1.pdf

EC

----------------------------------------------------------------------

How diseases reach equilibrium 

	Diseases that invade have high values of \Ro

	\Reffec\ must be 1 at equilibrium

		Potentially infectious contacts are wasted

			Many potential contacts are not susceptible (affected by
			disease)

			Those not affected less susceptible than average

		Infectious pool less infectious

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Spatial and network models

	Individual-level, or spatial, heterogeneity also usually
	increases wasted contacts

	Infectious people meet:

		people with similar social backgrounds

		people with similar behaviours

		people who are nearby geographically or in the contact network

	More wasted contacts further flatten the endemic curve

Multi-group models

	Divide the population into groups. 

		cities and villages

		rich and poor

		high and low sexual activity

		age, gender

		...

	Even if details are not correct, heterogeneity will emerge and move model in
	the right direction

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Individual-based models

WFIG 0.8 tmpfigs/network.png

	Allow many possibilities:
	
		vary individual characteristics

		add a network of interactions

		let the network change

	Individual-based approaches require stochastic models

Summary

PIC WFIG 0.32 tmpfigs/crowd.jpg

	People are heterogeneous in many ways

		\ldots and on many scales

	Simple models give us important qualitative insights

		Diseases in heterogeneous populations are likely to be more robust to
		change than expected from homogeneous models

	More complicated models can help address relevant detail
