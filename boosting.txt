Abstract for EMNID 2023 Sep

Conceptual models of immunity

I will discuss “leaky” and “polarized” conceptions of vaccination, the weaknesses of each, and how they are linked by immune bridging. I will also relate these to the “status-based” and “history-based” approaches to modeling both vaccination and viral-strain cross-protection

History of this work

	Innovative influenza cross-immunity models by Julia Gog

		CREDIT \url{https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11942531/}

	My attempts to understand conceptual under-pinnings

	Michael (WZ) Li (PHAC) asking practical questions that made me share my
	ideas

	Daniel (Sang Woo) Park took the lead in making this a real project

		With help from Jess Metcalf and Bryan Grenfell

What do modelers assume about vaccines?

	Leaky model: 80% efficacy means that each individual is 80% protected (20%
	chance of infection relative to naive individual)

	Polarized model: 80% efficacy means that 80% of individuals are completely
	protected (20% are unprotected)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

What does it mean to be protected?

	Against death?

	Severe outcomes?

	Transmission?

	Measurable infection?

	Immune response?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

How do we model immunity?

	History-based

		What exposures has an individual had?

		Maps naturally to leaky immunity (vaxxed individuals are all the same)

	Status-based

		What is an individual immune to?

		Maps naturally to polarized immunity

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Limitations

	Polarized approach assumes that a substantial proportion of the population
	is completely unprotected

		Unrealistic

		But how intrinsic is this assumption?

	Leaky approach ignores failed challenges

		These are challenges that would counter-factually infect with protection

		But I could resist one today and succumb next week

Vaccine effectiveness

	Efficacy: protection with a controlled exposure

	Effectiveness: protection in a population

	Project effectiveness under different assumptions

		Cumulative incidence

		Instantaneous hazard

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Incidence-based effectiveness

Questions going forward

	Vaccine vs~infection-driven immunity

	Protection against what?

	Immune waning

	A broader view of leakiness

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Leakiness

	We can define leakiness as any gap between efficacy and effectiveness

		We can imagine different standard challenges for efficacy

	Should we be thinking only about number of challenges?

		What about dose-dependence?

		Can these be cleanly disentangled?
