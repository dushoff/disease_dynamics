Goals

	This lecture will:

		introduce the idea of dynamical modeling

		explain why dynamical modeling is a key tool for understanding infectious
		disease

		discuss and demonstrate simple dynamical models from the SIR model family

		investigate some insights that can be gained from these models

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Dynamical modeling connects scales

REP DBFIG 0.7 SIR_model_family/trans.jpg 1 Disease_data/ewmeas.Rout.pdf

	Start with rules about how things change in short time steps

		Usually based on \emph{individuals}

	Calculate results over longer time periods

		Usually about \emph{populations}

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Dynamical modeling is a bridge

	If we see (or change) actions, how can we predict population-level outcomes?

	If we observe population-level outcomes (or their changes), what can we
	infer about individual-level actions?
