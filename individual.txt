SEC Introduction

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Goals

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Modelling individual events

	Differential equations model continuous processes

	Disease spreads in the real world through discrete events

	Discrete events are fundamentally stochastic

		Even in theory we don't know when the next event will occur, nor
		even what it will be

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Types of stochasticity

	Demographic stochasticity is caused by the existence of individual
	people and discrete events

	Environmental stochasticity refers to events that affect more than
	one person at a time

		Weather

		Politics

		Economics

Model world

	Fixed \Ro

	Model spread by disease generation

		Generations don't overlap \emph{or} we're being sophisticated

	No recovery, birth or death

		ANS Maybe disease is too fast

PRESLIDE Probability distributions

	Our practical example was equivalent to using which probability distribution?

		ANS Binomial

	What are other distributions we could have used, and what would that mean?

Probability distributions

	Our practical example was equivalent to using which probability distribution?

		ANS Binomial

	What are other distributions we could have used, and what would that mean?

		Poisson preserves the mean, but neglects the population size

			Can be good when population size is unknown or large

			ANS compared to the mean

		Poisson $\to$ negative binomial \\ binomial $\to$ beta binomial
		\\ allow for additional sources of variance

			ANS Analogous to environmental stochasticity

----------------------------------------------------------------------

SEC A continuous-time framework

----------------------------------------------------------------------

States and rates

	We describe our system in terms of the {\em probability rates}
	of events happening

		If the rate of event $E$ is $r_E(t)$, the probability of the
		event occurring in the time interval $(t, t+dt)$ is	$r_E(t) dt$

	If we assume that event rates depend on measurable states then waiting times
	are exponential

		We'll talk about relaxing this assumption

Analogy

	The demographic model is an exact analogue of the deterministic one

		Conceptually

		In the limit as $N\to\infty$

SEC Analyzing stochastic systems

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Realizations and ensembles

	How do we think about the behavior of a stochastic process?

		A single example of how the process could go (e.g., from a
		stochastic simulation) is called a {\em realization}

		The universe of possible realizations is called the {\em
		ensemble}.

		The probability distribution that describes what state we expect
		the population to be in at time $t$ is called the {\em ensemble
		distribution}

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Some techniques

	Simulate one or many realizations

	Simulate the ensemble distribution

		Requires one state variable for each possible state of the system

	Solve the ensemble distribution dynamics exactly!

		Rarely possible

	Approximations to the ensemble distribution

Questions

	What kind of questions do we want to ask with a stochastic model?

		How does stochasticity affect disease dynamics?

			Spatial distribution

			Establishment

			Persistence

		How much variance do we expect stochasticity to cause?

		Under what circumstances can we eliminate or eradicate a disease?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The fate of infectious disease

	Fizzle

		Disease fails to ``establish'' 

	Burn-out

		Disease goes extinct after first epidemic

	Fade-out

		Disease goes extinct after system approaches quasi-equilibrium

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Mathematics

	Simple models can approximate:

		The probability of fizzle, and burn out

		The average time until fade-out if the system survives fizzle and burn-out

	What about permanence

		Mathematically impossible! Why?

		ANS In practice, corresponds to a very large average time until fade-out

----------------------------------------------------------------------

TSEC Conclusions

	Stochasticity is real

		People are individuals

		The world has weather, and history

	Even minimal stochasticity can have dramatic effects on
	models of disease transmission

		Amplified by acquired immunity 

	Stochastic models are hard, and we usually combine techniques to
	understand them

	Even though it's real, you may not need it for your research question
