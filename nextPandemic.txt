What has changed?

	Sanitation, hygiene, clean-water access

	Germ theory of disease!

	Antibiotics

	Vaccines?

	Antiviral drugs

	Much of this could collapse, in an apparently unstable world

----------------------------------------------------------------------

TSEC Acute respiratory viruses (ARVs)

	Can spread relatively rapidly

		Often before characteristic symptoms can be detected

	Spread through the air

	Not susceptible to traditional antibiotics

	ADD Flu cover

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Circulating examples

	Influenza

	Coronaviruses

	RSV

	Adenoviruses

	Entero- and rhinoviruses

	Metapneumo- and parainfluenza viruses

----------------------------------------------------------------------

SS Why is it flu?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Flu is highly effective at evolving

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Flu is spreading in new species

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Flu has caused many pandemics in the past

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Flu caused the deadliest pandemic we know about

----------------------------------------------------------------------

SS Why is it not flu?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

COVID

	COVID was not flu

		This caused some early confusion with health guidelines!

ADD Covid explosion pictures

----------------------------------------------------------------------

How unusual was COVID?

	The 2019 pandemic was based on

		A totally immunologically naive population

		A virus not well adapted to the upper respiratory tract

			Less spread, but more severe disease

		A tightly linked global population

	Is COVID evolving to be Just Another Seasonal Coronavirus?

	Could one of the JASCs (common-cold coronaviruses) have caused a similar
	pandemic if its ancestor had not been introduced until this century?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Tradeoffs

	Our respiratory tracts look very different to pathogens as we move from the
	throat down into the lungs

		Maybe the result of evolution: the pathogens that spread best are less
		likely to kill us

	New ARVs (not specifically adapted to humans) may generally cause more
	serious disease

----------------------------------------------------------------------

More counterfactuals

	How deadly would the Spanish flu be today?

		It was far worse than COVID in reality

		But a big portion of the deaths were slow and could probably have been
		prevented by antibiotics

			Other deaths could have been prevented by oseltamivir

		Disruptions from World War I probably slowed responses

----------------------------------------------------------------------

How unusual is influenza?

	If it's possible to be as flexible at evolving as influenza, why aren't
	there more pathogens that do it?

		Maybe there are!

	\scv\ evolved more rapidly than we were expecting

	Common cold viruses are under-studied, and maybe underestimated

----------------------------------------------------------------------

But the pandemics!

ADD HA subtype tree

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Syndromic quarantines

	The 2009 pandemic response was included travel advisories and quarantines
	for people with fever and cough

		This was never going to stop or slow the spread of pH1N1

		But did it do something else?

TSEC Public-health preparation

	Governments have scaled \emph{down} COVID surveillance programs

		but not replaced them with broader programs

	Readiness will require hybrid programs

		Useful against current threats

		Help prepare for the next pandemic

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Plan

	Combine data streams

		Short-term forecasting of ARVs for healthcare planning

		Burden assessments for resource allocation and research prioritization

	Focus on circulating ARVs
