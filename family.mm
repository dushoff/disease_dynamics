R0 = beta D is important because it predicts:
How quickly a disease will spread initially
How quickly a disease will spread at any given time
Whether a disease will increase or decrease initially
Whether a disease will increase or decrease at any given time

In our simplest compartmental model, R-effective = beta D S/N can decrease:
When the proportion of susceptibles decreases
When the government imposes movement restrictions
When infectious people choose to reduce their contacts
All of the above
